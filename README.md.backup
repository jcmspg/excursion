Excursion
==================
### Off-Platform Project: Excursion
#### Learn Git & GitHub

##### Subject:

In this project, we'll create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” I'm going to use **HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub**.

The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
